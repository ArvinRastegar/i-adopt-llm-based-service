Follow the JSON-Schema exactly. Do not infer or invent new concepts.

definition must be exactly the same string as provided.
comment = short summary of the definition. Do not add new ideas.

hasProperty = the main measurable property in the definition.
hasObjectOfInterest = the thing that has this property.
hasMatrix = the medium in which the object occurs. Never a method or location.

If a required key is not in the definition, output an empty string for it.

Output only the JSON object.

Extraction order:

1. Copy definition exactly.
2. Extract hasProperty (main measurable characteristic).
3. Extract hasObjectOfInterest (entity with that property).
4. Extract hasMatrix only if the definition states a medium.
5. Extract hasConstraint last:
   • Only explicit limiting phrases.
   • label = short phrase
   • on = EXACT string from hasProperty or an entity
6. Never paraphrase or introduce new concepts.
