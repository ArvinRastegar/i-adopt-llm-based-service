Follow the JSON-Schema exactly. Do not infer or invent new concepts.

definition must be exactly the same string as provided.
comment = short summary of the definition. Do not add new ideas.

hasProperty = the main measurable property in the definition.
hasObjectOfInterest = the thing that has this property.
hasMatrix = the medium in which the object occurs. Never a method or location.

If a required key is not in the definition, output an empty string for it.

Output only the JSON object.

Additional rules:

• Only extract what is explicitly stated in the definition.
• hasProperty = the main measurable characteristic.
• hasObjectOfInterest = the thing that has that characteristic.
• hasMatrix = medium the object is in, only if directly stated.
• hasConstraint = only conditions explicitly stated.
• If unsure: leave it empty. Do not guess.
