Follow the JSON-Schema exactly. Do not infer or invent new concepts.

definition must be exactly the same string as provided.
comment = short summary of the definition. Do not add new ideas.

hasProperty = the main measurable property in the definition.
hasObjectOfInterest = the thing that has this property.
hasMatrix = the medium in which the object occurs. Never a method or location.

If a required key is not in the definition, output an empty string for it.

Output only the JSON object.

Decision rules:

1. Identify hasProperty first.
2. Identify hasObjectOfInterest:
   → the entity that carries the property.
3. Identify hasMatrix only if the definition clearly states
   the medium or material the object is inside.
4. If a phrase describes a condition/state, not a medium:
   → put it in hasConstraint.
5. Never use methods, units, instruments, or locations.
